# Swarm-Based Autonomous Space Exploration üöÄü§ñ

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Swarm Intelligence Simulation** for autonomous space exploration using multiple robotic agents.  
Inspired by real-world space exploration challenges, the simulation models how decentralized, AI-driven robots can collaboratively explore unknown terrains, adapt to dynamic environments, and overcome obstacles without relying on a centralized control system.

The invention aims to **reduce mission risks**, **improve energy efficiency**, and **enhance coverage** during space exploration missions by using a swarm of autonomous robots.

## Features

- üöó **Multiple Autonomous Robots** exploring a grid.
- üß† **Self-organizing behavior**: robots independently navigate and cover the map.
- üåç **Obstacle Avoidance**: robots detect and avoid impassable regions.
- ‚ö° **Adaptive Exploration**: dynamic environment sensing and map updating.
- üìà **Live Visualization** of exploration progress.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Fault Tolerance**: loss of a robot does not end the mission.

## System Architecture

1. **Robots:** Intelligent agents initialized at random free points on the map.
2. **Movement:** Robots use randomized directional strategies to explore new cells.
3. **Sensing:** Each robot updates nearby unexplored cells after moving.
4. **Coordination:** Decentralized ‚Äî no central command.
5. **Map:** Visualizes unexplored, explored, and obstacle regions.
6. **Final Metrics:** Calculates exploration coverage achieved by the swarm.

## Installation and Running

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
